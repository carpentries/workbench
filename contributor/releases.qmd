title: "Release Process for Workbench Packages"
---

## Background

The Workbench contains three main packages:

 - [{sandpaper}]\: user interface and workflow engine
 - [{pegboard}]\: parsing and validation engine
 - [{varnish}]\: HTML templates, CSS, and JS elements

Each of these packages are available on the [Carpentries R-Universe][r-universe]
and new versions are checked for hourly. This allows folks to get up-to-date
versions of the Workbench packages built for their system without running out
of GitHub API query attempts.

In order to maintain quality, packages are only sent to the R-Universe if they
have been formally released on GitHub ([as specified in the packages.json
configuration
file](https://github.com/carpentries/universe/blob/0c330a1e8f0337de483144fece37c2710af6f4df/packages.json#L16-L33)).
This allows us to incrementally add new experimental features without changing
the stable deployments.

## Release Process

When a package is ready for release we use the following checklist:

 - [ ] Update version number in DESCRIPTION
 - [ ] Add NEWS for the changes in this version
 - [ ] Ensure all changes are committed and pushed
 - [ ] add new signed tag with the name "<package> X.Y.Z"

      ```bash
      # example: create a signed (-s) tag for sandpaper 3.3.3
      git tag -s 3.3.3 -m 'sandpaper 3.3.3'
      ```
 - [ ] create a release on github from the new tag


::: {.callout-note}

Zhian likes to create tags via the command line because he has set up his git
configuration to use [a gpg signature](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/signed-verified-git-commits-keybase-rstudio/#fnref3)
so the tags and the releases are both verified.

:::

The last two items can be achieved in a single step with the [github
cli](https://cli.github.com/) with the command `gh release create X.Y.Z` for
the version number

```bash
gh release create 3.3.3
# ? Title (optional) sandpaper 3.3.3
# ? Release notes  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
#   Write my own
# > Write using generated notes as template
#   Leave blank
```

Selecting "Write using generated notes as a template" opens an editor and
populates it with the pull requests that have been accepted since the last
release.

Once the relase is created on GitHub, then the package will be available on
the R-Universe in about an hour or less.
