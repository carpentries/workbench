title: The Carpentries Workbench
subtitle: An accessible lesson infrastructure
---

The Workbench is a [complete redesign of The Carpentries lesson
websites](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/08/lesson-template-design/), with
new features prioritising accessibility and navigation for Learners and
Instructors. By separating the tools from the content of the lesson, The
Workbench makes it easier for Maintainers and Authors to focus on the content of
the lesson and not the tooling. To try it out, head over to [the Resources
section](#resources).

## Testimonials


 > [The Workbench] has provided an easy way to navigate the various parts of the lesson and
 > switch between or share the training content including instructor notes
 > seamlessly.

 > [editing a lesson] was pretty easy. I was doing this at the end of a long day and my brain
 > was only half on. It seemed to just work.

## Resources

The Workbench is built using the [R language](https://r-project.org) as a suite
of three R packages: [{sandpaper}], [{pegboard}], and [{varnish}] that work
together with R's robust publishing ecosystem and [pandoc](https://pandoc.org)
manage and deploy Carpentries Lesson websites written in Markdown or R Markdown.


### Usage

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Within R

To preview a lesson that uses The Workbench, open R (or RStudio), [install The
Workbench](#installation), and run the following command to start a live preview
that will update while you edit:

```r
sandpaper::serve()
```

#### From the command line

To preview a lesson that uses The Workbench, make sure you [install The
Workbench](#installation), and run the following command to start a live preview
that will update while you edit:

```bash
R -e 'sandpaper::serve(quiet = FALSE, port = "3435")'
```

You can then open your browser to <http://localhost:3435> preview your lesson as
you edit.

For more guidance on The Workbench, including how create a new lesson, run
accessibility tests, and more, consult our [Guides](#guides)


### Installation

To install the workbench, make sure you have a working version of R and 
pandoc/RStudio installed (see [the workbench setup instructions for 
details](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/)).

#### Setup with Anaconda

Thanks to Travis Wrightsman for [providing the instructions to setup for
anaconda](https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/issues/50). These lines
will set up an anaconda environment that includes all the dependencies you need
to use The Workbench. 

```sh
conda create -n workbench 'git>=2.28' 'r-base>=3.6' 'pandoc>=2.11' pkg-config libxslt
conda activate workbench
R -e 'install.packages(c("sandpaper", "varnish", "pegboard", "tinkr"), \
  repos = list(carpentries="https://carpentries.r-universe.dev/", CRAN="https://cloud.r-project.org"))'
```

:::

From there, you can install the workbench packages and their dependencies from
our [Carpentries R Universe](https://carpentries.r-universe.dev) inside of R:

```r
install.packages(c("sandpaper", "varnish", "pegboard", "tinkr"),
  repos = c("https://carpentries.r-universe.dev/", getOption("repos")))
```



### Updating

To update workbench packages, you can use the same command as you did to install
your packages:

```r
install.packages(c("sandpaper", "varnish", "pegboard", "tinkr"),
  repos = c("https://carpentries.r-universe.dev/", getOption("repos")))
```
