The Workbench is a complete redesign of The Carpentries lesson websites, with
new features prioritising accessibility and navigation. **All Carpentries lessons
will begin using The Carpentries Workbench in May 2023.**

In order to build the website locally, the easiest is to run `sandpaper::serve()`
in your Rstudio console.
Refer to the resources section below to guide you through installations of detailed explanations. 

## Resources

### Installation

To install the workbench, make sure you have a working version of R and 
pandoc/RStudio installed (see [the workbench setup instructions for 
details](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/)).

From there, you can install the workbench packages and their dependencies from
our [Carpentries R Universe](https://carpentries.r-universe.dev):

```r
install.packages(c("sandpaper", "varnish", "pegboard", "tinkr"),
  repos = c("https://carpentries.r-universe.dev/", getOption("repos")))
```

### Updating

To update workbench packages, you can use the same command as you did to install
your packages:

```r
install.packages(c("sandpaper", "varnish", "pegboard", "tinkr"),
  repos = c("https://carpentries.r-universe.dev/", getOption("repos")))
```
