    "section": "Authoring",
    "text": "Authoring\nThese FAQs are intended for those who contribute to, maintain, or create lessons using The Workbench. If you only ever visit the website, then head over to the Teaching or Learning sections.\n\nWhy was R chosen for the infrastructure?\nMost tools for webpage authoring outside of Wordpress and the like expect authors to have some knowledge or ability to manipulate HTML, CSS, JavaScript and one (or two) other languages to wrangle them all together. It’s great for people who are dabbling in webpage development, but as we’ve seen for several years now, it’s not great for people who do not have much experience with these technologies (think about the last time you assisted someone to install Jekyll correctly).\nWe chose R for four main reasons:\n\nIt has a really robust publishing ecosystem\nIt is available as a binary application on all major platforms with a packaging system that more often than not just works\nMost of all: The R community as a whole is vibrant, diverse, welcoming, and is most aligned with The Carpentries core values.\nIt provides a throughline between the tools we teach and real-world applications.\n\nWe tested the infrastructure in 2021 to make sure that it works for people with varying levels of familiarity with R: See this Blog Post from 2021 on the Alpha Test of the infrastructure.\nZhian Kamvar has given two talks about The Workbench that go into a little bit more detail about why we chose R (which highlight the points above)\n\n\n\nTalk\nVideo\nSlides (with speaker notes)\n\n\n\n\nUsing R as a Community Workbench for The Carpentries Lesson Infrastructure\nUse!R 2021 Video\nhttps://zkamvar.github.io/user2021/#p1\n\n\nBuilding Accessible Lessons with R and Friends\nrstudio::conf(2022) Video\nhttps://zkamvar.github.io/rstudio-conf-2022/#p1\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I really need to use RStudio?\nNo. We recommend using RStudio for several reasons that pertain to ease of use and standardisation across systems, but we do not absolutely require it. If you are able to get Git, R, and pandoc installed on your system, then you do not need to use RStudio.\n\n\nWhat is an R Library?\nAn R library is a folder on your computer that stores R packages. When you install R packages, the first message you will see will probably be something like (on Windows):\nInstalling packages into ‘c:/Users/USER/Documents/R/win-library/4.0’\n(as ‘lib’ is unspecified)\nThis folder is where all of the R packages you install via install.packages() will live. If you ever need to look this up, you can use the .libPaths() function.\nSometimes, your R session will issue a warning that says a folder is not writeable and asks if you would like to use a personal library instead. In this case, select “yes”.\n\n\nWhy are there so many GitHub Workflows and what do they do?\nEach lesson contains a set of GitHub workflows that are important for the following tasks:\n\nbuilding the lesson and deploying it on GitHub (.github/workflows/sandpaper-main.yaml)\nvalidating and responding to pull requests\nautomated updates of workflows and (for lessons that use R) package cache\n\nThese workflows originate from {sandpaper} and are copied directly into each lesson as described in a README.md inside the {sandpaper} repository.\nYou can read technical details of how the workflows work and how they are connected by reading the Workflows section of the Remote Deployment Chapter in the Workbench Developer’s Guide.\n\n\nWhat are the md-outputs and gh-pages branches?\nThese branches are part of the remote two-step workflow.\n\nmd-outputs: contains rendered markdown files, cached to 1) speed up computations by skipping content that has not changed and 2) allow for comparison of rendered output in Pull Requests\ngh-pages: contains the rendered website.\n\n\n\nWhy is The Workbench creating so many md-outputs-PR branches?\nYou might notice that every time a valid pull request is opened, a new branch is created. Each branch is unique to a pull request and is automatically removed when the pull request is closed.\nThese branches are orphan branches that contain two commits: the first commit is the current state of the md-outputs branch containing the rendered markdown of the active lesson. The second commit contains the rendered markdown of the pull request. The diff between these commits can be used to analyse changes in output of R Markdown documents. For more information, please read the Auditing Pull Requests Chapter in the Introduction to The Workbench.\n\n\nHow do I add a custom logo?\nFor custom logos, you should do the following:\n\nfork {varnish}\nmodify the incubator-logo.svg and incubator-logo-sm.svg logos in the source/images/ folder.\nensure your lessons use the carpentries: 'incubator' and varnish:     'MYACCOUNT/varnish' keys in the config.yaml\n\n\n\nHow do I get my lesson to use a custom Workbench package?\nIf you have a custom version of a Workbench package (e.g. {varnish}, with different colours, logos, or badges), there are two steps to get your lesson to use it:\n\nensure your package is publicly available on GitHub\nin your lesson, specify your package using the custom engine declaration in the config.yaml\n\n\n\nIs there a Docker Container?\nAs of 2023-12-20, there is no official docker container, but the community has some around and created a few iterations as discussed in carpentries/workbench#39."

    "section": "Lesson Transition",
    "text": "Lesson Transition\nThis section is applicable for transitioning between the former carpentries/styles lesson infrastructure and The Workbench.\n\nHow do I transition my lesson to using The Workbench?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited Support\n\n\n\nDue to significant staffing changes in late 2023, The Carpentries is unable to provide support for transitioning unofficial lessons to use The Carpentries Workbench.\n\n\nYou can use the Lesson Transition Tool, which will:\n\ncreate a submodule for your lesson\nfilter out the infrastructure-related commits\ntransform the markdown syntax using {pegboard}\n\nIt requires Python, R, git, Make, and BASH (it is unknown if these routines will work with zsh). I have written out detailed instructions for the transition process, but please note: these assume you have administrative access to your lesson.\n\nInitiating and testing a lesson transtion\nTransitioning and uploading a lesson\n\n\n\nHow do I transition a long-running fork to using The Workbench?\nSee the above section for instructions. You can copy the lesson-specific transition script to your fork folder to make things easier (though this depends on when you last updated your fork). If you do not have any intention of recieving or contributing your changes to the source, then the above section should be all that you need.\nIf you want to continue updating your fork, it will be a little more complicated because it depends on when you last updated your fork. There is some discussion in carpentries/workbench#51.\nIn short, the commit histories will be identical up until the point of the fork and then the commit history will diverge (but still be relatively compatible) until the point of transition. You may be able to merge the upstream into your fork, but it will not be easy and it will likely contain several merge conflicts. This is not to say that it cannot be done, but it highly depends on the level of customisation you did in the fork. Take for example a fork of the shell-novice lesson that had 16 commits ahead of swcarpentry/shell-novice. Attempting to update the transitioned fork resulted in 188 conflicts1:\nUnmerged paths:\n  (use \"git add/rm &lt;file&gt;...\" as appropriate to mark resolution)\n    both added:      .github/workflows/sandpaper-version.txt\n    both added:      .gitignore\n    both added:      CONTRIBUTING.md\n    both modified:   README.md\n    both added:      config.yaml\n    both deleted:    data/data-shell.zip\n    both modified:   episodes/01-intro.md\n    both modified:   episodes/02-filedir.md\n    both modified:   episodes/03-create.md\n    both modified:   episodes/04-pipefilter.md\n    deleted by us:   episodes/05-loop.md\n    both modified:   episodes/05-script.md\n    both modified:   episodes/07-find.md\n    added by us:     episodes/data/data-shell.zip\n    added by them:   episodes/data/shell-lesson-data.zip\n    deleted by them: episodes/fig/redirects-and-pipes.png\n    both modified:   index.md\n    both added:      instructors/instructor-notes.md\n    both modified:   learners/discuss.md\n    both added:      learners/reference.md\n    both added:      learners/setup.md\n$ rg -c '&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;' \nindex.md:1\nconfig.yaml:5\nREADME.md:3\nepisodes/04-pipefilter.md:25\nepisodes/05-script.md:20\nepisodes/02-filedir.md:40\nepisodes/03-create.md:34\nepisodes/01-intro.md:3\nepisodes/07-find.md:25\ninstructors/instructor-notes.md:14\nCONTRIBUTING.md:2\nlearners/discuss.md:3\nlearners/reference.md:12\nlearners/setup.md:1\n$ rg -c '&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;' | awk -F: '{sum+=$2} END{print sum}'\n188\n\n\nLocal Clones\n\nHow do I update my clone after the transition from styles?\nThe easiest way is to rename your local clone to old-NAME (where NAME is the name of your repository folder) and then re-clone the lesson. You can find details on updating your local clone on the beta phase page.\n\n\n\nPost-transition GitHub Forks\n\nHow do I update my fork after the transition from styles?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you read further\n\n\n\nThis is only applicable if you have created a fork of the lesson before 2023-02-06.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not “synchronise” your fork\n\n\n\nIf you attempt to synchronise your fork from the GitHub interface and create a pull request, that pull request will fail. Instead, follow the instructions below.\n\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to delete your fork and re-clone. The commit history of the lesson has changed and you will be unable to commit until your fork reflects those changes (this is known as the burn it all down strategy):\n\nSave your edits on locally or in a scratch space.\nDelete your fork\nCreate a new fork or use the “edit” button on the page you wish to edit.\nApply your changes (NOTE The Workbench uses a different syntax. Here is a Transition Guide from Styles to Workbench for your reference).\n\nNote that if you have a clone, you will need to also delete and re-clone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction Forks\n\n\n\nIf you have a fork of a lesson that you have modified significantly and wish to continue maintaining under The Workbench, contact Zhian Kamvar and he will help you transition your repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontributing without deleting\n\n\n\nIf you contribute directly on the lesson itself using the “edit” button on GitHub, a new branch will be created for you and you can edit on that branch without deleting your fork.\nThis method is not recommended because it runs the risk that you will accidentally merge histories in your fork."

    "text": "Teaching\n\nGitHub Forks\n\nHow do I create a fork for teaching?\nA common pattern for teaching is to create a fork of a lesson, modify it to add or remove specific section. Because the pages on The Workbench are deployed by GitHub actions, there are a couple of extra steps you need to do to enable the pages to load after the transition.\nIn short, when you fork, to make it easier, you should bring in all branches, enable GitHub pages, and enable GitHub Actions. After that, you will have your lesson website and can teach from it.\nYou can find the instructions in issue 14 of the Dovetail blog series.\n\n\n\nWorkshop Websites\n\nHow do I add episodes to my workshop website?\nBefore 2020, instructors were occasionally encouraged to copy the episodes from a lesson into their workshop website to avoid situations where the lesson would change significantly while the workshop was being taught. In short, you can not do this. Instead, you can make a fork of the lesson and link that on your workshop website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComing up: versioned lessons\n\n\n\nIn the future, we will implement lesson versioning where you will be able to select a specific version of a lesson to teach from, so that you can always be sure that the content is stable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow-rent versioning with HTMLpreview\n\n\n\nThe website https://htmlpreview.github.io allows you to display HTML pages hosted on GitHub without needing to set up GitHub pages. If you do not want to fork, but still want a working version you can teach from, you can head to a workbench repository, select the gh-pages branch, select the index.html file and click on copy permalink and paste that into html preview:\nFor example: this is the workbench documentation as of 2023-02-07: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper-docs/blob/59651a69e7716c04edaf8f9c1c79abc18ce3e476/index.html\nThis is a very workable version of the lesson (with some styling differences as the default font could not be loaded).\nThe only catch is that you have to manually switch to instructor view by the URL: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper-docs/blob/59651a69e7716c04edaf8f9c1c79abc18ce3e476/instructor/index.html\nAnd there you have a quick version of the lesson."

It requires the following major pieces of software to run:\n\nGit\nRuby\nBASH\nMake\nPython2\nR3\n\nThe styles workflow is a Jekyll-based workflow, which uses the following components:\n\nbundler: manages the Ruby gems (packages) including Jekyll\nJekyll: static site generator\n(file) Makefile: workflow management for building and validating\n(dir) assets/: CSS and JS elements\n(dir) _layouts/: HTML templates\n(dir) bin/: intialisation, runtime, and validation scripts (in BASH, Python, and R)\n(dir) _includes/: Markdown and HTML boilerplate for customisation\n\nThe file components can only be updated via pull request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContributor Count\nBecause content and tools are separated in Workbench Lessons, giving credit for the lesson is much more straightforward. Here we use Dr. Sarah Gibson’s Cross-Stitch Carpentry lesson as an example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkbench\nThe Contributors reflect those that actually worked on the lesson itself.\n\n\n\nList of contributors reflects the lesson content contribution (note that Dr. Gibson is listed first)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstyles\nThe Contributors reflect those that worked on the lesson AND those that worked on the underlying infrastructure, going back to 2013.\n\n\n\nList of contributors reflects lesson content and styles (note that Dr. Gibson is now fifth!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Rendering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkbench\n\nIf you haven’t already, Follow the setup instructions for the workbench to install R, pandoc, and the workbench packages\nIn your lesson directory, open either R, RStudio, or VS Code and run:\n\nsandpaper::serve()\n\n\n\n\nstyles\n\nIf you haven’t already, Follow the setup instructions for styles to install Ruby, Bundler, Jekyll, Make, Python, and BASH\nIn your lesson directory, open your command line and run:\n\nmake serve\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFolder Structure\nThe folders from styles to Workbench are rearranged to achieve the following goals:\n\ntools for building the lesson do not live in the lesson 4.\nthe episodes can be directly lifted from the lesson without needing external context/resources.\nextra content intended for instructors is clearly separated from that intended for learners\n\nEpisodes (aka Chapters) will move from _episodes/ and _episodes_rmd to the single folder episodes/. _extras/ content will be split into learners/ and instructors/ depending on the context of the content.

Markdown source content on the other hand is copied to the site/built folder.\nBecause R Markdown files can take some time to render, we use MD5 sums of the episode contents (stored in the site/built/md5sum.txt file) to skip any files that have not changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    autonumber\n    participant episodes/episode.Rmd\n    box rgb(255, 214, 216) The Workbench\n    participant {sandpaper}\n    end\n    box rgb(230, 234, 240) Document Engine\n    participant {renv}\n    participant {knitr}\n    end\n    box rgb(255, 231, 168) Generated Files\n    participant site/built/md5sum.txt\n    participant site/built/episode.md\n    end\n\n    site/built/md5sum.txt --&gt;&gt; {sandpaper}: READ file cache\n    {sandpaper} --&gt;&gt; {knitr}: RUN conversion\n    episodes/episode.Rmd --&gt;&gt; {knitr}: PROCESS changed file(s)\n    {knitr} --&gt;&gt; site/built/episode.md: WRITE Markdown\n    {sandpaper} --&gt;&gt; site/built/md5sum.txt: WRITE file cache\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage Cache and Reproducibility\n\n\n\nOne package that is missing from the above diagram is {renv} and that’s partially because it has an indirect effect on the lesson: it provisions the packages needed to build the lesson.\nWhen episodes are rendered from R Markdown to Markdown, we attempt to reproduce the build environment as closely as possible by using the {renv} package. If the global package cache from {renv} is available, then the lesson profile is activated before the episode is sent to {knitr} and R will use the packages provided in that profile. This has two distinct advantages:\n\nThe user does not have to worry about overwriting packages in their own library (i.e. a graduate researcher working on their dissertation does not want to have to rewrite their analyses because of a new version of {sf})\nThe package versions will be the same as the versions on the GitHub version of the site, which means that there will be no false positives of new errors popping up\n\nFor details on the package cache, see the Building Lessons With A Package Cache article.\n\n\nAt this step, the markdown has been written and the state of the cache is updated so if we re-run this function, then it will show that no changes have occured. After this step, the internal function sandpaper:::build_site() is run where the markdown file that we just created is converted to HTML with pandoc and stored in an R object. This R object is then manipulated and then written to an HTML file with the {varnish} website templates applied.\nWe use this function in the pull request workflows to demonstrate the changes in markdown source files, which is useful when package versions change, causing the output to potentially change."

This is done via the internal function sandpaper:::render_html().\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    autonumber\n    box rgb(255, 214, 216) The Workbench\n    participant {sandpaper}\n    end\n    box rgb(230, 234, 240) Document Engine\n    participant pandoc\n    end\n    box rgb(255, 231, 168) Generated Files\n    participant site/built/episode.md\n    end\n\n    {sandpaper} --&gt;&gt; pandoc: LOAD pandoc with lua filters\n    site/built/episode.md --&gt;&gt; pandoc: READ markdown\n    pandoc --&gt;&gt; {sandpaper}: RENDER HTML as text\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here, the HTML exists as the internal body content of a website without a header, footer, or any styling. It is nearly ready for insertion into a website template. The next section details the flow we use to tweak the HTML content.\n\n\nProcessing HTML\nThe HTML needs to be tweaked because the output from pandoc, even with our lua filters, still needs some modification. We tweak the content by first converting the HTML into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This allows us to programmatically manipulate tags in the HTML without resorting to using regular expressions.\nIn this part, we update links, images, headings, structure that we could not fix using lua filters. We then use the information from the episode to complete the global menu variable with links to the second level headings in the episode.\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    autonumber\n    box rgb(255, 214, 216) The Workbench\n    participant {sandpaper}\n    end\n    box rgb(230, 241, 255) R Object\n    participant HTML(AST)\n    end\n    box rgb(230, 234, 240) Helper Package\n    participant {xml2}\n    end\n\n    {sandpaper} --&gt;&gt; {xml2}: READ HTML\n    {xml2} --&gt;&gt; HTML(AST): PARSE HTML\n    activate {sandpaper}\n    note right of HTML(AST): sandpaper:::fix_nodes()\n    {xml2} --&gt;&gt; HTML(AST): update structure\n    HTML(AST) --&gt;&gt; {sandpaper}: extract menu items\n    note right of {sandpaper}: generate learner and instructor versions\n    deactivate {sandpaper}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking With XML\n\n\n\nWorking with XML data is perhaps one of the strangest experiences for an R user because in R, functions will normally return a copy of the data, but when working with an XML document parsed by {xml2}, the data is modified in place.\nIt allows us to do neat things, but there is a learning curve associated.\n\n\n\n\nApplying Website Template\nNow that we have an HTML AST that has been corrected and associated metadata, we are ready to write this to HTML. This process is achieved by passing the AST and metadata to {pkgdown} where it performs a little more manipulation, applies the {varnish} template, and writes it to disk.\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    autonumber\n    box rgb(255, 214, 216) The Workbench\n    participant {sandpaper}\n    participant {varnish}\n    end\n    box rgb(230, 241, 255) R Object\n    participant HTML(AST)\n    end\n    box rgb(230, 234, 240) Helper Package\n    participant {pkgdown}\n    end\n    box rgb(255, 231, 168) Generated Files\n    participant site/docs/episode.html\n    end\n\n    activate {sandpaper}\n    {sandpaper} --&gt;&gt; {pkgdown}: Set global menu variables\n    HTML(AST) --&gt;&gt; {pkgdown}: Hand off HTML to pkgdown\n    deactivate {sandpaper}\n    activate {pkgdown}\n    {varnish} --&gt;&gt; {pkgdown}: Load template\n    {pkgdown} --&gt;&gt; site/docs/episode.html: WRITE website\n    deactivate {pkgdown}"

We also want to give our community confidence that this system works.\nWhenever a new feature or bug fix is added to The Workbench, it is imperative that a test is associated and verified before it gets sent into production.\nTests can be run locally and via continuous integration. This page introduces some of the testing strategies used in The Workbench and the caveats that come with these strategies."

During the transformation, we will also excise the commits from styles, which necessarily rerwite the history of the lesson, while preserving the commits from lesson content. This move has two benefits: 1. The list of committers on the lesson will better reflect the actual lesson contributors rather than the contributors to the template. 2. Lessons will be reduced in size so that downloading them and contributing to them will be easier. There is precedence for this: When Software Carpentry moved its lessons from the original swcarpentr/bc monorepo, they excised the commits related to each lesson from the repository, but preserved the history.↩︎"

Everything else is ignored locally.\n\n\nWe use the two-step process because it provides us an air-gap between the tools needed to build the markdown and the tools needed to render the website. It also provides us a ready cache of outputs so that R Markdown source content does not need to be re-rendered. Moreover, we designed these tools to be independent from each other so that if, in the future, we can mix and match with different tools as they become available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe two-step process is not new; the {rmarkdown} package uses this process behind the scenes, but it will discard the markdown output by default.\n\n\n\n\nValidation\nLesson validation is performed by {pegboard} by parsing Markdown and evaluating the elements for low-hanging fruit of accessibility:\n\nLink and Image Validity\nFenced Div Validity\nHeading Validity\n\nThe validation of lesson elements is performed before the lesson is built, so that the contributor can address any issues even if they have a broken component in the rest of the toolchain. Invalid lesson elements are displayed on the contributors R console with information about the location of the error, an explanation of what was wrong, and a link to resources to help explain the error and offer correction.\n\n\nIn Practice\nBecause of the need for bootstrapping, validation, and caching, the number of steps from source files to lesson website is considerably more than two. The diagram below describes shows the process by which a lesson is built using the workbench.\n\nThe lesson contributor has an idea and writes it in Markdown or R Markdown\nThe lesson contributor runs sandpaper::serve() to start the engine.\n{sandpaper} passes this file to {pegboard}, which checks it for accessibility and reports to the user if there are any errors\n{sandpaper} passes the file to {knitr}, which renders the file to Markdown and stores it in the site/built folder\n{sandpaper} passes the file to PANDOC, which renders the Markdown to HTML (this is temporarily stored as a character vector in R)\n{sandpaper} passes the HTML to {pkgdown}, which applies the templates from {varnish}, creating the lesson website."

The only twist is that these files are necessarily ephemeral because we will never be building the site on the same server day to day, so how do we avoid rebuilding markdown intermediates and HTML outputs when we do not track them by git?\nThe answer is with orphan branches that map on to the folders in site/ using git worktrees, which is achieved via the internal function sandpaper:::ci_deploy().\n\n\n\nFolder\nBranch\nContents\n\n\n\n\nsite/built\nmd-outputs\nMarkdown outputs and rendered files (e.g. images)\n\n\nsite/docs\ngh-pages\nHTML outputs for the live website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of the sandpaper:::ci_deploy() process\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlossary\n\n\n\n\norphan branch\n\nOrphan branches are separate branches known to git that share no common history with the main branch.\n\nwork tree\n\nWork trees are a special git workflow that allows you to work on multiple for the same repository in separate folders.\n\n\n\n\nEach time a commit happens on the main branch, the main branch is checked out and then git worktrees are provisioned inside of the site/ directory for each branch via the internal function sandpaper:::git_worktree_setup(), which is modified from Hadley Wickham’s pkgdown::deploy_to_branch() function. After they are provisioned and the contents populated from the existing branches, then they appear on the remote system just like they appear on your local system and the lesson can be updated without rebuilding everyting.\nOnce it is all done, the contents are pushed to their respective branches, the worktrees are disassembled, and the remote runner is released to another task."
